We modified AndroidManifest.xml and added <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/> so the app can reach the Flask server.
For the Ui we added a new InferenceMode enum for ON_DEVICE / CLOUD along with a radio button in the bottom sheet for selection. 
In the MainViewModel we use this to determine whether to use the existing classify function or our new classifyRemote function, which posts the frame to http://10.0.2.2:5050/predict and then emits the results like the classify function did. We also cover any connection exceptions and display a toast to prevent the app from crashing if the server isn't on.
